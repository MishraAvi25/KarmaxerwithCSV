# KarmaxerwithCSV
A tool that finds two data points. First, how many words are in the titles of the top-rated posts of the past 24 hours. Second, how long ago these posts were made. It parses for these two points and then creates separates list for the two. Which are then put into a CSV file that can be used for other functions.
